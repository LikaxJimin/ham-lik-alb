            <p> Having looked at the world around you through our
                camera, you can add geometric shapes to it, as
                Infante - Arana Francesco and Goryunova Nonna
                did in their series of photos “Close in the Far, Distant
                in the Near” without Photoshop.The first thought that came to me after we learned about the new project and about the artwork that our
                group got caught, I realized that I want to show with my work everything that Infante did. Infante’s work
                consists of a series of landscape photographs where he placed geometric shapes that look like they were
                added using Photoshop. Therefore, we have found a way to make such a “camera” with the help of which
                museum visitors will repeat the actions of the author and understand what the work is about.</p>

            <p> We were given the opportunity to work with the space at the cashier where tickets are sold. Our task was
                to find out some information about the visitors. This was not only to analyze the attendance of the
                exhibition, but also to entertain and interest visitors.</p>

            <p> I moved from a 2D image to another 2D image. I cut out pieces of photos of nature, animals, buildings, the sky and so on from an atlas map.</p>
