                found an old movie called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yjqLAzYlCc">The Cat’s-Paw.</a> in which the main character and the woman he likes are similar

        <p>For this project, I had to create a fictional conference with its theme and story, then to make 2 posters for it. My theme became Sleep paralysis. I didn’t
            know much about it, but as it happened to me several times, I became more and more interested in it. If
            you do not know what sleep paralysis is, then I advise you to read about it, as it is much deeper than you
            can imagine.</p>

                • One side of my t-shirt should contain only text. No images. <br>
                • Another side of my t-shirt should contain only images (up to 10). No text. 
                Images could be made by me or found. I was not allowed to use the 
                company logo & graphic language or pictures-drawings of any products they 
                make. <br>
                • Both sides of my design had to be black and white. <br>
                Soooooo, on their website I found an information that In one year a person makes 400kg of waste and it became my main idea.
